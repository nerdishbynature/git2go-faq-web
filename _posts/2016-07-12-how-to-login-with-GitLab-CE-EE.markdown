## Steps

2. __Select Remote Logins__, here you will find all your existing logins and you are able to login to GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, GitHub Enterprise and self-hosted GitLab installations
3. Tap on __GitLab Enterprise__
4. __Type in the URL__ you would normally use to access the installation in your browser, e.g. "https://gitlab.nerdishbynature.com"
5. Tap __Get private Token__
6. A web page will open and greet you with your personal private token
7. Select and __copy the token__ to your clipboard
8. __Tap__ the __Done__ button
9. __Git2Go will automatically detect the token__ in the clipboard and fill it into the form
10. __Tap Connect__, Git2Go will now retrieve the users information and show it in the overview. *All information will be stored on your device only - nothing is sent to remote servers.*
