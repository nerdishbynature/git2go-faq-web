title: How to clone from SSH
---

If you happen to have a self-hosted Git server or use a Git front end which is not supported by Git2Go (like Beanstalk or Bitbucket Server) you can still clone all your repositories. To do so just follow these simple steps:

1. Create a SSH Key in Settings
2. Copy the SSH public key to your Server
3. Copy the URL you want to clone to your clipboard (most clients let you copy this URL from the web front end)
4. Go to Repositories -> SSH
5. Your Repo should be shown and you can tap it to start cloning
