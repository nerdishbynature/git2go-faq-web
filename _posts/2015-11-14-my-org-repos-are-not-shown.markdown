Are you missing repositories of organisations you belong to?

GitHub recently added a security feature for organisation admins where they can restrict access to repositories to non-approved third-party applications.

If your admin did enable this feature it is likely that these repositories are hidden from Git2Go. If you happen to be the administrator of the organisation simply follow these links to give Git2Go access:

[For Git2Go](https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/2385a352f56cf07d0534) and for [Git2Go Enterprise](https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/dcd90008816d6b9614de).
