## Steps

1. Tap the "History"-tab in the TabBar
2. When you see the list of commits, simply pull the list down to refresh.
3. Git2Go will now pull in any changes that might have happened since your last pull.
4. Afterwards all commits you have made on your iOS device are pushed to the remote.
5. Activity is indicated in a small label beneath the spinner stating "Pulling …" and "Pushing …"
